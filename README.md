AI Systems Engineer · Agent Architecture · Distributed Backend Infrastructure

## About

Backend engineer with 16+ years of experience building scalable production systems.

Currently focused on designing and shipping:

* LLM-powered agent orchestration systems
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
* Distributed task execution platforms
* Evaluation and reliability harnesses
* Backend microservices (FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL)

I work at the boundary between probabilistic AI models and deterministic production systems.

Generative AI is stochastic.
Infrastructure cannot be.

That tension is where good engineering happens.

## Current Focus

### 🧠 Agent Systems

* Multi-agent execution loops
* Tool routing & structured outputs
* Streaming response pipelines
* Failure recovery & retry strategies
* State management in long-running workflows

### 📚 Retrieval Infrastructure

* Hybrid search pipelines
* Embedding normalization & scoring strategies
* Evaluation metrics for retrieval quality
* FAISS → cuVS experimentation

### ⚙️ Distributed Backend Architecture

* Async task orchestration
* Background job queues
* Message brokers
* API contracts & schema-first design
* Observability & debugging under load

## Selected Work

### Agent Orchestration Platform (Production)

Designed a multi-agent execution system integrating:

* Tool routing
* RAG context injection
* Structured outputs
* Streaming + background processing
* Failure handling and retries

Built using FastAPI, Celery, Redis, and PostgreSQL.

### RAG Evaluation Harness

Implemented automated evaluation pipelines to:

* Measure retrieval quality
* Compare embedding strategies
* Detect hallucination risk
* Benchmark latency under load

## Certifications

* NVIDIA AI Certified: Generative AI
* NVIDIA AI Certified: Agentic AI Applications with Large Language Models
* Codeable Certified WordPress Expert

## Engineering Principles

* Explicit over magical
* Boring systems > clever hacks
* Deterministic boundaries around probabilistic models
* Clean architecture enables iteration
* Production reliability is the real benchmark
