## About

I architect production AI systems.

For over 16 years, I’ve built scalable backend infrastructure. Today, I design deterministic systems around probabilistic models: multi-agent orchestration platforms, retrieval infrastructure, and distributed execution engines that operate reliably under load.

I don’t build AI demos. I build systems that survive production.

My work sits at the boundary between stochastic language models and deterministic software architecture. That boundary is where most systems fail and where real engineering matters.

Core domains:

* Multi-agent orchestration and execution engines
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) infrastructure
* Distributed task systems and background processing
* AI evaluation harnesses and reliability tooling
* Schema-first backend architecture using FastAPI, Celery, Redis, and PostgreSQL

Generative models are probabilistic.
Infrastructure must not be.

## Architecture Focus

### 🧠 Agent Systems

* Multi-agent coordination graphs and execution loops
* Tool routing and structured output enforcement
* Streaming pipelines with background task isolation
* Failure recovery, retry policies, and state reconciliation
* Long-running workflow orchestration

Designed to eliminate silent failure modes and nondeterministic behavior in AI-driven systems.

### 📚 Retrieval Infrastructure

* Hybrid search pipelines combining sparse and dense retrieval
* Embedding normalization and scoring strategies
* Retrieval evaluation using precision, recall, and nDCG
* FAISS to cuVS experimentation and performance benchmarking
* Hallucination risk mitigation through retrieval grounding

Built to transform retrieval quality from intuition into measurable signal.

### ⚙️ Distributed Backend Systems

* Asynchronous task orchestration and worker pools
* Message brokers and job queues
* Schema-first API contracts and strict boundaries
* Observability, tracing, and load diagnostics
* Deterministic control planes around AI components

Focused on reliability, not novelty.
